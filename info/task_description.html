    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor">The greatest common divisor</a>,
    also known as the greatest common factor of two or more integers (at least one of which is not zero), is the
    largest positive integer that divides the numbers without a remainder. For example, the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4.
</p>
<p>
    You are given an arbitrary number of positive integers.
    You should find the greatest common divisor for these numbers.
</p>

<p><strong>Input: </strong> An arbitrary number of positive integers.</p>

<p><strong>Output: </strong> The greatest common divisor as an integer.</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre class="brush: python">
great_common_divisor(6, 4) == 2
great_common_divisor(2, 4, 8) == 2
</pre>

<p class="for_info_only">
    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    GCD is a basis for mathematical software.
    But this is a good example of simple algorithm which come to us from ancient times.
