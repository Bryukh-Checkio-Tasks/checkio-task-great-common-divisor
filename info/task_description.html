    <p>With the generator fixed, the lights sputter to life. The hall grows dim, then brighter as each shadow is erased
        from sight.</p>

    <p>“Well, that’s that.” Sighed Nikola as he wiped the grease off his hands.</p>

    <p>“And not a quantum fluctuation or rip in fabric of the space time to be found.” Said Sofia. “Come on! Let’s
        explore!” She took off down the hall leaving the guys behind in her dust. “Don’t dally! COME ON!”</p>

    <p>“Wait up!” Stephen trotted after her.</p>

    <p>The three bots came to a dim chamber surrounded with pillars and grooves in the wall. On these grooves were
        markings that seemed to glow, giving them an ethereal appearance.</p>

    <p>“What on-” Started Nikola.</p>

    <p>“Hang on,” piped in Sofia “This looks like music! Yes! These markings look like musical notes and each pillar
        breaks the composition into bars! Genius!”</p>

    <p>“It looks like some of the music is missing.” Noticed Stephen.</p>

    <p>“Well, let’s finish it! We can’t very well leave a song unfinished!” Sofia seemed excited at the prospect of
        composing a song.</p>

    <p>“No harm in that.”</p>
</div>
<p>
    To write the rest of the song, Sofia needs to come up with a perfect rhythm according to the Euclidean Algorithm. In
    order to calculate it she will need the greatest common divisor of two positive numbers (n>0).
    Write a function that will calculate a greatest common divisor of two numbers.
</p>

<p><strong>Input: </strong>A list of two integers.</p>

<p><strong>Output: </strong>The greatest common divisor. An integer.</p>

<pre class="brush: python">checkio((12, 8)) == 4
checkio((14, 21)) == 7
checkio((13, 11)) == 1
